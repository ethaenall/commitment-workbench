// The decision-closure check: a range of chain entries in,
// a verdict out naming each decision as clean, conflicted, unresolved, or
// unchecked. Pure by the discipline verify-chain.ts holds — no I/O, no
// logging, no clock, no timers (a per-file eslint block enforces it; see
// eslint.config.mjs). Unlike verify-chain.ts it imports nothing at all, so
// for this file the node:* ban has no transitive exception.
//
// It lives BESIDE verifyChainRange, not inside it: `BreakKind` stays closed
// around "was the chain mutated", and a semantic conflict — two closers on
// one decision — is not a tamper signal. The one duplicate the engine
// deliberately writes (two identical dispatch-recovery closers) and the one
// correction it permits (a truthful closer landing after a wrong one) are
// both real rows with intact hashes.

/**
 * Lifecycle rows record something that happened to the SYSTEM, not a governed
 * tool call: synthetic `service`/`verb` outside the tool registry and a fixed
 * governance `decision` placeholder. Lifecycle metadata, `outcome`, and
 * `errorMessage` describe the event, not a governed service execution.
 * Matched on `toolName` because the record carries no column saying "this row
 * is a lifecycle event". This is the one definition (moved here from the CLI
 * render); `packages/engine/src/dev-model/page.ts` keeps an inline copy only
 * because that file is client JavaScript inside a template string and can
 * import nothing — keep the two in step until the record gains an explicit
 * discriminator. The engine writers are `createSessionInTxn`,
 * `writeSessionEnd`, `writeTaskCancelAudit`, and the refinement manager
 * transaction callback in `UserAgent`. Refinement rows describe local artifact
 * lifecycle, never a resolved service attempt or an authorization grant.

/**
 * Whether the log still owes this entry a closer. One predicate, implemented

 *
 *   1. a row that carries a referent of its own is an outcome row and owes
 *      nothing, whatever its `decision` word says;
 *   2. of the rest, a lifecycle row is not a decision at all, so it owes
 *      nothing;
 *   3. a `deny` entry is terminal by itself and owes nothing;
 *   4. a `pending` entry owes one;
 *   5. an `allow` entry owes one — the `executeTool` decision written before
 *      dispatch.
 *
 * Clause 1 first is what the two rows in the write inventory turn on. The
 * spend-supersede row carries `decision: "pending"` AND a referent: under a
 * pending-first order it would owe a closer it can never receive (the same
 * transaction writes a FRESH `pending` entry for the spending hold and
 * relinks the held row to it, so every later closer names the fresh entry),
 * and would read unresolved for the life of the log. Under clause 1 it is a
 * closer of the entry below it and owes nothing itself. The ledger-failure
 * row names an OUTCOME entry; clause 1 on the referent side is what keeps
 * that outcome entry from being read as a decision that owes one.
