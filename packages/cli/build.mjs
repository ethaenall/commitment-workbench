// Bundle the CLI to a single Node-runnable entry.
//
// The published `habenula` bin can no longer be `src/bin.ts` under a Bun
// shebang — Node cannot execute TypeScript directly. esbuild bundles the whole
// source tree (plus the workspace-local @habenula-ai/audit, whose hash,
// verify-chain, and decision-closure code the CLI value-imports and which ships
// as .ts, so it MUST be transpiled). Governed-learning commands also value-import
// @habenula-ai/contracts and its Zod validators for strict local wire/file checks.
// These are bundled into dist/index.js, stamped with a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang
// and marked executable. Node built-ins stay external. Dev still runs from
// source via `tsx src/bin.ts` (the `dev` recipe); this bundle is what `bin`
// points at and what npm publishing ships.
//
// The build also inlines the workspace engine's exact version as
// __HBN_ENGINE_VERSION__ (an esbuild define) for `habenula up`'s npx
// resolution. A define rather than a dependency, deliberately: declaring
// @habenula-ai/engine in dependencies would put a workerd binary into every
// CLI install, including the ones that only talk to a remote engine. A failed
// read fails this build, so the bundle never ships a placeholder.
