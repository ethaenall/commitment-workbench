// The published-manifest transform: what a tarball's package.json carries that
// the committed one does not. Pure and table-driven — the table below is the
// reviewable artifact, and a unit test asserts it covers every subpath the
// committed manifests declare (plus the deliberate additions in
// ADDED_ENTRIES, and nothing else).
//
// The committed trees stay working workspaces that resolve ./src/*.ts; only
// the staged copy this script rewrites points at dist/. It runs in the publish
// job's ephemeral staging tree — nothing it writes is ever committed.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: `private`, the entry points, and `scripts`.
// No dependency edge, no version, no package name — the pin re-check in the
// driver is the tripwire that catches this scope widening later.
